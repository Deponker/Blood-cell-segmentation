## Short Description:
With the advent of deep learing algorithms in medial domain, there is a need for quality and large datasets. In this work, we introduced the largest microscopic blood cell segmentation dataset and benchmark different state-of-the-art algorithms on it. Our findings and contributions are particularly helpful for researchers working in deep learning with applications in medial domain.
